## 2. REVENUE ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Revenue by Category Performance

**Top Performing Categories:**

| Category | Revenue | Market Share | Order Count | Avg Order Value |
|----------|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Sports | $527,297 | 25.4% | 512 | $1,030.23 |
| Books | $424,541 | 20.4% | 399 | $1,063.91 |
| Electronics | $386,342 | 18.6% | 362 | $1,067.51 |

| Clothing | $363,622 | 17.5% | 410 | $886.39 |

**Key Insights:**

1. **Diversified Revenue Stream** - No single category dominates (top category = 25.4%). This reduces risk and indicates strong product-market fit across multiple segments.

2. **Sports Category Leadership** - Despite having slightly fewer orders than Clothing, Sports generates 45% more revenue per order ($1,030 vs $886). This suggests:
   - Higher average product prices in Sports
   - More premium customer segment attracted to Sports products
   - Opportunity to replicate this pricing strategy across categories

3. **Books Outperformance** - Books has the highest AOV ($1,063.91), suggesting:
   - Customers are willing to spend more on specialized knowledge
   - Potential for bundled offerings (e.g., book + related products)
   - Premium positioning opportunity

4. **Balanced Portfolio** - Revenue distribution suggests healthy market segmentation and product strategy. No category is underperforming (<17% would be concerning).

**Business Recommendation:** Investigate what's driving Sports' superior AOV and apply those insights to Clothing and Home & Garden categories to increase revenue per transaction.

### 2.2 Margin Analysis

- **Margin by Category:**
  - Home & Garden: $184,116 (49% margin)

  - Sports: $240,328 (46% margin)

- Opportunity to renegotiate Sports category suppliers or optimize logistics

**Business Impact:** A 5% margin improvement in Sports would add ~$26K to annual profit. **Priority: Review Sports sourcing strategy.**
